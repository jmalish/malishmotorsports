<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>When it all comes down to it, we're just like you, we want to go fast. We don't just want to go fast though, we want to go faster than the other guys. We've made it our purpose to help others meet similar goals.</p>
<p>All of our instructors come from a history of racing cars, giving them the experience they need to teach you the ins and outs of turning the fastest possible laps.</p>
<p>We're based out of Charlotte, North Carolina at Charlotte Motor Speedway. This track is home to some of NASCAR's greatest history. It offers a 1.5 mile oval, in what is known as a "cookie-cutter" shape. It additionally has a challenging in field road course that requires a wide variety of skills to master.</p>
<p>One of the things that sets us apart from other driving schools is that we have access to a top of the line racing simulator. This allows us to show each student the correct driving line, and gas and brake points in a unique way including different virtual camera angles. It also allows our students to drive on the track with no worry of getting hurt as they learn.</p>
